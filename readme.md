Rides simulates the basic flow of a ride-hailing app. It consists of five main components:

- The __simulation engine__ generates the system's state and updates the database.
- The __database__ persists the state.
- The __web server__ exposes the state via a RESTful API to the client.
- The __UI__ presents the real-time state of the system.
- The __monitoring & logging__ stack provides observability of the system.

Technologies used include __Node.js__ (simulation), __Go__ (web server) and __PostgreSQL__. The frontend is written in __React__. All JavaScript is typed with __TypeScript__. Monitoring is implemented with __Prometheus and Grafana__. All backend components are containerized with __Docker__.

The system is running on a single machine with 2 GiB of memory. The distributed nature of the system is already somewhat simulated by using containers. My plan eventually is to spread it across multiple virtual servers, thus achieving a true distributed system.

## Simulation engine

The key components of the simulation are the __*Driver*__ and __*Customer*__ instances. These instances make periodical decisions in an infinite loop. These decisions include, among others:

- Spawn and deactivation
- Request for the optimal route
- Request for a new destination
- Passenger pick-up
- Advancement of the car on the map
- Passenger drop-off

Multiple __*Driver*__ and __*Customer*__ instances are running simultaneously within the same process. The simulation process is lightweight - its purpose is only to run the simulation loops and update the state.

To ensure the simulation stays performant and the updates happen within the predefined interval, it is imperative that the more expensive calculations do not block the main process. Such calculations include:

- Generating destinations
- Calculating the optimal route
- Matching customers with drivers

For this reason, these calculations are running as child processes. Each of these processes maintains a queue. __*Customer*__ and __*Driver*__ entities request data from these services as needed and await a response. They might complete several simulation cycles before the response arrives, at which point they start acting according to the new information.

## Database

The database is PostgreSQL and stores the data in __*customers*__ and __*drivers*__ tables:

__*customers*__: id, customer_id, name, active, location, destination, driver_id  
__*drivers*__: id, driver_id, name, status, location, path, text, path_index, customer_id, customer_name

*While a NoSQL database is probably more suitable for this project due to schema flexibility and better write throughput, I wanted more hands-on experience with SQL, since in my previous projects and work experience, NoSQL has been prevalent. This is a common theme in this project - I might choose a particular technology simply because Iâ€™m interested in exploring it.*

## Web server
The web server is written in Go. It exposes the data via a RESTful API at the __*/customers*__ and __*/drivers*__ endpoints and servers the frontend application. It also exposes the Grafana dashboard via a proxy.

## UI

The frontend application is written in React. The frontend polls the server for updates in 1 second intervals. The map visualization is implemented from scratch. On receiving an update, it spreads the movement of the car until the next update, achieving a smooth animation in small increments.

## Monitoring & logging

Monitoring & logging stack is implemented with Prometheus & Grafana. It provides observability of the system parameters such as disk space and memory, as well as container-specific metrics.
